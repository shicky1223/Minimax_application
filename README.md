# Minimax Application

Minimax Application is a project that implements the minimax algorithm—a core decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. The minimax algorithm is part of the adversarial search family of AI and assumes that both players play optimally. One player (the “maximizer”) tries to maximize their score, while the other (the “minimizer”) aims to minimize the maximizer’s score. This means that, at each move, you assume your opponent will choose the move that is worst for you.

In this repo, I used Pygame to create a GUI for Tic Tac Toe and the minimax algorithm to develop an agent that always minimizes the player's score. Essentially, this agent will never lose; it will either beat the player or tie with them.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements the core minimax algorithm to evaluate game states and choose optimal moves.
- **AI Opponent:** Play against an AI that uses minimax to provide challenging gameplay.
- **GUI with Pygame:** Enjoy a visually interactive Tic Tac Toe game with a user-friendly interface.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular codebase that can be extended or modified for different games or advanced features.
