Minimax algorithm is an algorithm that is a part of the adverserial serach family of AI. The minimax algorithm assumes that both players play optimally. One player (the “maximizer”) tries to maximize their score, while the other (the “minimizer”) aims to minimize the maximizer’s score. This means that, at each move, you assume your opponent will choose the move that is worst for you.
In this repo, I used pygame to create a gui of tic tac toe, and the minimax algorithm to create an agent that will always try and minimize the players score. Essentially this agent will never lose, but rather always beat the player or tie with them.
